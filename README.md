Reasons/Info
--------
This project was created simply to have fun with Java and Gradle. I have learned a lot about Java networking and IRC in general. I helped a lot for me to look at
the example of [EiraIRC mod for Minecraft](https://github.com/blay09/EiraIRC).

Eventually, this bot will be able to load up Java modules that can register their own Commands, Matchers, and Server sets (`IServer`, `IClient`, and `IChannel`).
This is currently in progress and the API should not be considered final until at least beta builds, if not final release builds.
The API will eventually be packaged separately for use in making modules.
